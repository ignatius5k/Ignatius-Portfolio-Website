            <p class="article-meta">October 16, 2025 · by Ignatius</p>
            
            <p>For one of my coding projects, I built a Python-based trading portfolio simulator — a console app that lets you “trade” using fake data while tracking your holdings, cash, and daily performance.

I designed it to feel like a lightweight personal portfolio tracker. The app includes core functions like buying, selling, editing holdings, viewing market prices, and generating performance reports. Each “trading day” updates prices randomly within ±5% to simulate real market changes.<p>
<div class="features">
<p>Some of the main features:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Save and load portfolios to JSON</li>

	<li>Simulated market updates</li>

	<li>Dynamic cash and holding management</li>

	<li>Transaction history and daily summaries</li>
	
	</ul>
</div>

<p>The logic behind it mirrors how a real trading platform works — with functions for average price recalculation, cash balance updates, and total value computation. I kept the data fake, but the design and math are realistic.<p>

This project helped me practice data structuring, state management, and file persistence in Python. It also made me appreciate how trading systems handle continuous price updates and user interactions in real time.

It’s a simple, text-based project, but it captures the essence of portfolio management — and it’s something I plan to later expand with a graphical interface and real market data integration.
